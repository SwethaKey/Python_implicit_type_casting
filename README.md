# Python_implicit_type_casting
# 1. Implicit: done by Compiler
# Example 1
=> 1) int/int = float type
=>    6/3 = 2.0 always

# Example 2
=> 2) user can enter a number like X vlaue but it is internally type is str 


# 2. Explicit: done by programmer using build-in function.
# Example
=> p = 400
   q = 500
   print(int(p/q))
